# In order to make an object compatible with the with statement, you need to
# implement __enter__() and __exit__() methods. For example, consider the
# following class, which provides a network connection:

from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
class LazyConnection:
    def __init__(self, address, family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM):
        self.address = address
        self.family = AF_INET
        self.type = SOCK_STREAM
        self.sock = None

    def __enter__(self):
        if self.sock is not None:
            raise RuntimeError('Already connected')
        self.sock = socket(self.family, self.type)
        self.sock.connect(self.address)
        return self.sock

    def __exit__(self, exc_ty, exc_val, tb):
        self.sock.close()
        self.sock = None

# The key feature of this class is that it represents a network connection, but it
# doesn’t actually do anything initially (e.g., it doesn’t establish a
# connection). Instead, the con‐ nection is established and closed using the with
# statement (essentially on demand). For example:

from functools import partial
conn = LazyConnection(('www.python.org', 80)) # Connection closed
with conn as s:
    # conn.__enter__() executes: connection open
    s.send(b'GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\r\n')
    s.send(b'Host: www.python.org\r\n')
    s.send(b'\r\n') resp = b''.join(iter(partial(s.recv, 8192), b''))
    # conn.__exit__() executes: connection closed
